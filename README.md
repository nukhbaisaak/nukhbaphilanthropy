#### Description:
Nukhba Philanthropy is a website for a charity foundation of the Maison, Nukhba, a company founded in 2019 in the capital city of Dubai. It is a fine jewelry company. The website has not been published and s just a blueprint of the foundation.

Nukhba philanthropy is the Maison's foundation that fund bold non-profit organizations such as Save The Children and International Rescue Committee,
that address the many challenges of poverty and drive long-term positive change in the poorest regions of the planet.

The web-application includes 10 pages for now:

- **index.html** is the homepage of the website. It contains a carousel that highlights some of the projects of the organization. Below which is a little description of the organization with a button that redirects to AboutUs.html , below that is the focus area section which highlights the organization main focus areas of philanthropic operations. Next is the Discover how we work section which summaries the organization's working standard with a button that redirects to the How-we-work.html

- **Aboutus.html** is a page that is designed to convey to the user about what the organization is about. It highlights the foundation's vision, it's mission and it's values. It enlightens the user about the organization focus areas and has a section that gives a summary about how the organization works and contains a button to lead the user to the how we work page.

- **How-we-work.html** is a page that describes the criteria an organization must meet in order to receive funding by us. It explains our funding criteria, how we fund, and what we do not fund.

- **layout.html** is a page that is the base layout of all the pages of the web application. It includes a navigation bar that has the organizations logo and contains four navigation bar items: 1. *Who We Are* 2. *What We Fund* 3. *Register* 4. *Login* The *login* and *Register* items change to *Donate* or *Log Out* once the user has logged in. The footer of the web application contains a section with a logo again along side a newsletter subscription section that allows the user to stay updated to the organizations new projects. The second section of the footer contains an accordion with three items: 1.  **Quick Links** which allows the user to navigate the user to three different pages; - *Aboutus.html* - *fundings* - *all-news.html*

- **register.html** is a page that allows the user to register by entering a new username and password.

- **newsletter.html** this page allows the user to sign up to the newsletters by entering their details such as *first name*, *last name*, *email* and *organization*

- **login.html** allows the user to login into an existing account

- **thankyou.html** greets the user with a thank you message after they make a donation

- **fundings.html** allows the user to browse through the non-profit organizations that we support and fund and perhaps have partnered with in the previous years.

- **apology.html** apologizes to the user when an error has required

- **subscription-success.html** greets the user with a message when they have subscribed to the newsletter successfully

- **donate.html** allows to user to make a donation. the page asks for the amount of money they would like to donate and the cause they would like to donate to.

- **donations.html** allows to user to check out their previous donations. It displays a table containing the the amount of donations they have made to certain causes , total donations they have made and the total cash they have available in their account balance.

That is the complete description of my website. I look forward to adding more webpages such as a *News.html* page that shows the users about the organization recent projects and more.
I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating it.

Kind regards!
